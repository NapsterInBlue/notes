It is completely possible to use feedforward neural networks on images, where each pixel is a feature. However, when doing so we run into two major problems. \n", "\n", "First, a feedforward neural networks do not take into account the spatial structure of the pixels. For example, in a 10x10 pixel image we might convert it into a vector of 100 pixel features, and in this case feedforward would consider the first feature (e.g. pixel value) to have the same relationship with the 10th feature as the 11th feature. However, in reality the 10th feature represents a pixel on the far side of the image as the first feature, while the 11th feature represents the pixel immediately below the first pixel. \n", "\n", "Second, and relatedly, feedforward neural networks learn global relationships in the features instead of local patterns. In more practical terms, this means that feedforward neural networks are not able to detect an object regardless of where it appears in an image. For example, imagine we are training a neural network to recognize faces, these faces might appear anywhere in the image from the upper right to the middle to the lower left. The power of convolutional neural networks is their ability handle both of these issues (and others)."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 3, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Start neural network\n", "network = Sequential()\n", "\n", "# Add convolutional layer with 64 filters, a 5x5 window, and ReLU activation function\n", "network.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(5, 5), input_shape=(channels, width, height), activation='relu'))\n", "\n", "# Add max pooling layer with a 2x2 window\n", "network.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n", "\n", "# Add dropout layer\n", "network.add(Dropout(0.5))\n", "\n", "# Add layer to flatten input\n", "network.add(Flatten())\n", "\n", "# # Add fully connected layer of 128 units with a ReLU activation function\n", "network.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))\n", "\n", "# Add dropout layer\n", "network.add(Dropout(0.5))\n", "\n", "# Add fully connected layer with a softmax activation function\n", "network.add(Dense(number_of_classes, activation='softmax'))"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Compile Convolutional Neural Network"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 4, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Compile neural network\n", "network.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', # Cross-entropy\n", "                optimizer='rmsprop', # Root Mean Square Propagation\n", "                metrics=['accuracy']) # Accuracy performance metric"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Train Convolutional Neural Network"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 5, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"data": {"text/plain": ["<keras.callbacks.History at 0x103f9b8d0>"]}, "execution_count": 5, "metadata": {}, "output_type": "execute_result"}], "source": ["# Train neural network\n", "network.fit(train_features, # Features\n", "            train_target, # Target\n", "            epochs=2, # Number of epochs\n", "            verbose=0, # Don't print description after each epoch\n", "            batch_size=1000, # Number of observations per batch\n", "            validation_data=(test_features, test_target)) # Data for evaluation"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.3"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
