## Values Are Immutable


```scala
// Create a value called greeting that is a string with the word "Hello"
val greeting: String = "Hello"

// View the value
greeting
```




    Hello



## Variables Are Mutable


```scala
// Create a variable called age that is a "short" number (between -32768 to 32767) with the number 12
var age: Short = 12

// View the variable
age
```




    12
