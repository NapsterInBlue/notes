I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer formally trained as a quantitative political scientist. Currently I am Chief Data Scientist at the Kenyan startup [BRCK](https://www.brck.com/). Previously, I founded [New Knowledge](http://www.newknowledge.io) and the data science podcast, [Partially Derivative](http://www.partiallyderivative.com). Prior to New Knowledge, I led [Ushahidi's](http://www.ushahidi.com) work on crisis and humanitarian data and launched [CrisisNET](https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2014/06/09/introducing-crisisnet). I was also the Director of the low-resource technology Governance Project at [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com).

I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Davis researching the quantitative impact of civil wars on health care systems. I earned a B.A. from the University of Miami, where I triple majored in political science, international studies, and religious studies.
