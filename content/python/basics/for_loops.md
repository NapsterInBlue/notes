```python
# One at a time, assign each value of the sequence to i and,
for i in [432, 342, 928, 920]:
    # multiply i by 10 and store the product in a new variable, x create a new variable, x,
    x = i * 10
    # print the value of x
    print(x)
# after the entire sequence processes,
else:
    # print this
    print('All done!')
```

    4320
    3420
    9280
    9200
    All done!
