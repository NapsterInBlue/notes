This snippet is a completely inefficient simulator of a 20 sided dice. To create a "successful roll" the snippet has to generate  dozens of random numbers.

## Import random module


```python
import random
```

## Create a variable with a TRUE value


```python
rolling = True
```

## Create a while loop that rolls until the first digit is 2 or less and the second digit is 10 or less


```python
# while rolling is true
while rolling:
    # create x, a random number between 0 and 99
    x = random.randint(0, 99)
    # create y, a random number between 0 and 99
    y = random.randint(0, 99)
    # if x is less than 2 and y is between 0 and 10
    if x < 2 and 0 < y < 10:
        # Print the outcome
        print('You rolled a {0}{1}.'.format(x, y))
        # And set roll of False
        rolling = False
    # Otherwise
    else:
        # Try again
        print('Trying again.')
```
