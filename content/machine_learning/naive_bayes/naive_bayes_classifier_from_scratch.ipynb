    "A gaussian naive bayes is probably the most popular type of bayes classifier. To explain what the name means, let us look at what the bayes equations looks like when we apply our two classes (male and female) and three feature variables (height, weight, and footsize):\n",

    "- $P({\\text{male}})$ is the prior probabilities. It is, as you can see, simply the probability an observation is male. This is just the number of males in the dataset divided by the total number of people in the dataset.\n",
    "- $p({\\text{height}}\\mid{\\text{female}})\\,p({\\text{weight}}\\mid{\\text{female}})\\,p({\\text{foot size}}\\mid{\\text{female}})$ is the likelihood. Notice that we have unpacked $\\mathbf {\\text{person's data}}$ so it is now every feature in the dataset. The \"gaussian\" and \"naive\" come from two assumptions present in this likelihood:\n",
    "    1. If you look each term in the likelihood you will notice that we assume each feature is uncorrelated from each other. That is, foot size is independent of weight or height etc.. This is obviously not true, and is a \"naive\" assumption - hence the name \"naive bayes.\"\n",
    "    2. Second, we assume have that the value of the features (e.g. the height of women, the weight of women) are normally (gaussian) distributed. This means that $p(\\text{height}\\mid\\text{female})$ is calculated by inputing the required parameters into the probability density function of the normal distribution: \n",

    "p(\\text{height}\\mid\\text{female})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\text{variance of female height in the data}}}\\,e^{ -\\frac{(\\text{observation's height}-\\text{average height of females in the data})^2}{2\\text{variance of female height in the data}} }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\text{marginal probability}$ is probably one of the most confusing parts of bayesian approaches. In toy examples (including ours) it is completely possible to calculate the marginal probability. However, in many real-world cases, it is either extremely difficult or impossible to find the value of the marginal probability (explaining why is beyond the scope of this tutorial). This is not as much of a problem for our classifier as you might think. Why? Because we don't care what the true posterior value is, we only care which class has a the highest posterior value. And because the marginal probability is the same for all classes 1) we can ignore the denominator, 2) calculate only the posterior's numerator for each class, and 3) pick the largest numerator. That is, we can ignore the posterior's denominator and make a prediction solely on the relative values of the posterior's numerator.\n",
