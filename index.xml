      <description>When examining the nature of your network&amp;rsquo;s arrangement, the concept of assortativity is a complicated, albeit deeply-intuitive one. You can think of it as the network analog to a correlation or coincidence score&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s bounded between [-1, 1] and represents how much nodes in the network have self-arranged with other nodes that look like it.
Data To dive into this concept, I&amp;rsquo;ll borrow a dataset representing faculty relationships at a university, keyed by the department they work in (group for each node).</description>

      <description>Node Inspection For this, we&amp;rsquo;ll throw together a bare-bones network representing a straight-line, directed path from 1 to 4, peppering in weights along the edges.
%pylab inline import networkx as nx F = nx.DiGraph() F.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, .3), (2, 3, .4), (3, 4, .5)]) Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib  Simple stuff, yeah?
nx.draw_networkx(F) Here, we built F with simple integers, but we could have just as easily used str or any other hashable type.</description>

      <title>Networkx vs Numpy/Pandas</title>
      <link>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/algorithms/graphs/numpy_pandas/</link>

      <description>Under the hood any data that you can represent in a graph, you can also represent as a matrix of values. Therefore, networkx has a ton of great tools for translating between graph thinking and your typical Data Science numpy/pandas fare.
Simple Data To demonstrate this, we&amp;rsquo;ll load the canonical dataset representing a group of kids in a karate cohort and measuring if they interacted outside of class at all.</description>

      <description>Building a Network from Unclean Data I&amp;rsquo;m working through Complex Network Analysis in Python and one of the earlier examples is just too good to pass up, wherein the author generates useful Network data by combing through links from a starting Wikipedia page.
This technique is called &amp;ldquo;Snowball Sampling&amp;rdquo; and entails starting from some seed, or starting point, and running the algorithm which &amp;ldquo;uses retrieved data to find more data,&amp;rdquo; hence snowball.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/python/development/logging_basics/</guid>
      <description>Overview The logging module in Python is a very powerful tool that I&amp;rsquo;ve summarily neglected learning until this week. However, as it&amp;rsquo;s often utilized as part of a robust ML pipeline, I finally took the plunge. In this notebook, I&amp;rsquo;m going to distill the basics I got from the docs, as well as show a simple project that highlights some of the behavior and configuration patterns.
Levels logging operates using a concept of &amp;ldquo;levels,&amp;rdquo; which correspond to varying levels of message-severity.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/python/pandas/to_json/</guid>
      <description>Motivation I&amp;rsquo;m currently going through the Deployment of ML Models course on Udemy and in the sixth module, they start implementing a testing suite to ensure stability in a package comprised of pandas, sklearn, and numpy.
I almost glossed over this section until I realized that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally up to speed what they were doing as far as formatting goes. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a ton about pd.read_csv() and felt pretty comfortable about that.</description>

      <title>LRU Caching</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/python/development/lru_cache/</guid>
      <description>Caching is an invaluable tool for lowering the stress of repeated computes on your expensive functions, if you anticipate calling it with a relatively-narrow set of arguments. I read about it in the context of model.predict() calls, but wanted to lean on a more canonical example to show the how performance compares, caching vs non. The code is lifted and altered from the functools.lru_cache() documentation.
By Example Below, I&amp;rsquo;ve got two identical implementations for recursively serving up Fibonacci numbers&amp;ndash; the only difference being that one of them counts the number of times the function is called, and the other caches the results its seen for later use.</description>

      <title>Advanced Silhouette Usage</title>
      <link>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/machine_learning/unsupervised/advanced_silhouettes/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/machine_learning/unsupervised/advanced_silhouettes/</guid>
      <description>As we mentioned in our notebook on Basic Clustering Evaluation Metrics, the Silhouette Score is a pretty robust tool to determine the appropriate number of clusters generated from an Unsupervised Algorithm.
However, months later, I stumbled across another post buried in the sklearn docs that further elaborated on more fine-tuned inspection of your data and where the model over-under performs. This notebook gives an overview of reading the plots, and highlights some of the tricks in generating them.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/python/pandas/tags_to_columns/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a few instances where I need to make clean, dummied data columns from a column that contains a list of attributes. This notebook will go one step further and show an example of generating one such list from a bunch of string fields, generated by concatenating arbitrarily-many &amp;lt;tag&amp;gt; objects together.
An Example In the repo Building Machine Learning Powered Applications, the author has a slick chunk of code that takes a DataFrame containing a column with a bunch of tags (I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped everything else, for simplicity&amp;rsquo;s sake)</description>

      <title>Using Calibration Curves to Pick Your Classifier</title>
      <link>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/machine_learning/model_selection/calibration_curves/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/machine_learning/model_selection/calibration_curves/</guid>
      <description>Motivation Very similar to our discussion on using QQ plots to check the Normality of your data, Calibration Curves are used to check the quantile relationship between your predictions and the underlying values they try to predict.
So what does that mean?
Recall that nearly all implementations of our Classifiers actually output a probability under the hood, which is compared against some threshold to make our decisions. Now imagine sorting all of those probability values, smallest to largest.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/python/viz/custom_legends/</guid>
      <description>Occasionally, the need might arise to generate your own custom legend for your data. I swear this happens often in the wild, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty proud of how contrived an example I cooked up.
Example Let&amp;rsquo;s say that we work for the Queenstown Ministry of Travel, that we have a naive understanding of causality, and that there&amp;rsquo;s a second Titanic ship coming into our port, which we know will sink.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/python/viz/multiclass_hists/</guid>
      <description>Looking at the different distributions of features between various classes is the first step in building any sort of classifier. However, even univariate analysis can lead to some cluttered visualizations fore more than a couple of different classes.
Example We&amp;rsquo;ll load up our old, reliable Iris Dataset
%pylab inline import pandas as pd from sklearn.datasets import load_iris data = load_iris() df = pd.DataFrame(data[&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;], columns=data[&amp;#39;feature_names&amp;#39;]) Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib  Map the 0, 1, 2 into actual flower names.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/algorithms/markov/markovify/</guid>
      <description>Markovify is one of the more elegant libraries I&amp;rsquo;ve come across. While it can be extended for general Markov Process use, it was written to generate novel sentences using Markov Chains on a corpus of text.
Its interface is extremely clean and astoundingly fast, fitting and predicting instantaneously
import re import markovify with open(&amp;#34;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer.txt&amp;#34;) as f: text = f.readlines() # drop chapter headings and blank lines text = [x for x in text if not x.</description>

      <description>Click is an excellent library that handles a lot of the minutate in setting up a robust Command-Line Interface.
There&amp;rsquo;s a TON of functionality built in, but I&amp;rsquo;m writing this notebook so I can remember how to set up straight-forward implementations, such as the one found in my library kneejerk

      <description>Occasionally, we&amp;rsquo;ll find ourselves building bridge tables that map many to many observations. For instance, we might have a table of Students and a table of Classes. Students can take multiple classes and likewise, classes can enroll multiple students.
Thus, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to create a table of records that maps all unique (student_id, class_id) pairs. Empahsis on unique.
We might do that like so

      <description>Review If your Stats 425 is still kicking around in your head, you might remember Bayes&amp;rsquo; Theorem. Which generalizes a nice, symmetric property of Conditional Probability
$P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A) P(A)$
Into the following
$p(H|D) = \frac{p(H)~p(D|H)}{p(D)}$
Where H is your Hypothesis and D is your Data.

      <description>An interesting application of our Bayesian Approach, the author of Think Bayes introduces a toy problem where we&amp;rsquo;ve got a bag of D&amp;amp;D dice, randomly select a die and roll it. From here, we want to know the probability that the die was a d4, d6, ..., d20.
What makes this problem novel/interesting is how repeated rolls of the selected die allow us to update our estimation.
Rolled a 6 In the simple case, imagine that we pulled out a die and rolled a 6.</description>

You probably know the setup:
- 3 Doors: A, B, C - 1 has a prize, 2 have a dud - You pick a door - Monty Hall opens a second door, revealing a dud - Do you switch to the open door?  You might have memorized that the optimal solution is &amp;ldquo;always switch.</description>

      <description>Often described as &amp;ldquo;the categorical analogue to PCA&amp;rdquo;, Correspondence Analysis is a dimension-reduction technique that describes the relationship and distribution between two categorical variables.
Reading papers on the topic proved to be needlessly dense and uninformative&amp;ndash; my lightbulb moment on this topic came when I stumbled across Francois Husson&amp;rsquo;s fantastic tutorial series on YouTube. 100% worth the watch and is where I&amp;rsquo;ll pull many of my images from.
Intuition For starters, this analysis assumes that our data is prepared as a cross-tabulation of two categorical variables.</description>

      <description>Overview One of the fundamental characteristics of a clustering algorithm is that it&amp;rsquo;s, for the most part, an unsurpervised learning process. Whereas traditional prediction and classification problems have a whole host of accuracy measures (RMSE, Entropy, Precision/Recall, etc), it might seem a little more abstract coming up with a comparable measure of &amp;ldquo;goodness of fit&amp;rdquo; for the way an unsupervised model aligns with our data.

      <description>As hinted at the end of our notebook on the Kaplan-Meier Estimator, we can enrich our approximations of Survival and Hazard curves by using covariate (attribute) data from our records. One of the most popular methods of doing so is by employing the Cox Proportional Hazard model.
Borrowing once more from the lifelines documentation, the Cox model estimates a given hazard function as

      <description>Survival Analysis, broadly-speaking, is a corner of statistics that deals with answering questions regarding &amp;ldquo;time to event&amp;rdquo; for a given population. It has applications in all kinds of contexts, from healthcare, to marketing, to manufacturing, etc.
There&amp;rsquo;s all sorts of nuance and rabbit-holing to be done, learning the ins and outs, but first, it&amp;rsquo;d help to establish some of the fundamental concepts and their derivations.
The Data Obviously, if we&amp;rsquo;re trying to train a model to make predictions on time and events, we need data that informs us of time spent as well as event occurences.</description>

      <description>So before we get underway with our fancy-pants tuned models to approximate our survival/hazard equations, it&amp;rsquo;s worth highlighting a simple estimator that provides a useful, if naive, approximation with minimal headache.
This straight-forward equation is called the Kaplan-Meier Estimate and is used as a proxy for evaluating the Survival Function at a given point in time.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/km_eq.PNG&amp;#39;) The n_i term is the population still at risk right before time i (not yet swallowed by F(t)), and d_i is the number of events that occur on time i.</description>

      <description>from IPython.display import Image Likelihood Josh Starmer does a great job succinctly explaining Likelihood as the counterpart to probability.
Whereas probability describes the chance of seeing an observation, given a probability distribution
Image(&amp;#39;../images/starmer_prob.PNG&amp;#39;) Likelihood describes the chance that we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a certain probability distribution, working backwards from given a sample.

      <description>Building Dummy Data In much the same way that libraries like sklearn and seaborn come, batteries-included, with utilities to pull canonical datasets or generate novel data following some known distribution, networkx provides dozens of similar utilities. The Graph Generators documentation houses far more methods than I know or care to cover. For simplicity&amp;rsquo;s sake, I&amp;rsquo;ll group these methods&amp;ndash; broady&amp;ndash; into three categories
Canonical This is used to generate known, well-documented, networks within the Network Science literature&amp;ndash; think Iris, but for dots and lines.</description>

      <description>Example: Compression Near the bottom of the writeup in the AMA, they demonstrate how useful SVD is a way of compressing/uncompressing data.
This will make a good working example as any.
They assemble a 25 X 15 matrix of zeros and ones that form an image of a 0. Per the example, there are really only different types of columns that go into constructing the bigger picture&amp;ndash; and thus some obvious information redundancy that we can leverage.</description>

      <description>This was one of the more illuminating math videos I&amp;rsquo;ve come across and it did wonders for grounding my intuition on this topic. This notebook will mostly follow along, typing ideas from our other notebooks.
Overview Recall the intuition that we arrived at for eigenvectors when we went from following our basis vectors i and j in a linear transformation to finding the eigenvectors and watching the transformation from the perspective of the stretch/shrink on these vectors.</description>

      <description>Overview Another Linear Algebra concept, another link to a great 3blue1brown video.
As we sort of teased out in our &amp;ldquo;Duality&amp;rdquo; section of our notebook on Dot Products, the orientation with which we perceive points in space is arbitrary, so long as our origin points, (0, 0), overlap.
Up to this point, we&amp;rsquo;ve always considered linear transformations with respect to how they manipulate our basis vectors i and j.</description>

      <description>Motivation Following along with 3blue1brown&amp;rsquo;s series on The Essence of Linear Algebra, the topic of Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues shows up nearly last.
When I learned this in undergrad, it was a series of equations and operations that I memorized. However, revisiting to write this notebook, I&amp;rsquo;ve now got a good intuition for conceptualizing eigenvectors represent, as well as understand their use/role in Linear Algebra.
For starters, he presents a matrix A that represents a simple linear transformation and encourages us to watch the yellow line below.</description>

      <description>Overview In his video on cross products, 3blue1brown kicks off by sharing that the cross product between two vectors v and w is the area of a parallelogram created by affixing each vector to the end of the other. Mathematically, this is equivalent to the determinant.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/cross_product_almost.PNG&amp;#39;) However, halfway through the video, he admits that this definition was simply to prep your understanding for the actual concept.</description>

      <description>Geometric Interpretation In his video on determinants, 3blue1brown provides a nice geometric interpretation for the determinant of a matrix, A.
 Generally, the determinant represents the factor by which a matrix scales the area/volume/etc after a linear transformation.
 This is a better approach than rote memorization of the formula for calculating a determinant and just rolling with it (like I did for years).
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/determinant_formula_2d.PNG&amp;#39;) 2D Intuition To see why this is the case, let&amp;rsquo;s consider a couple simple shapes/transformations.</description>

      <description>Overview The dot product between two vectors is simply the sum of the element-wise products between the two vectors, or:
np.dot([a, b, c].T, [d, e, f].T) -&amp;gt; ad + be + cf  This takes us from two vectors of arbitrary, shared, 1 x n dimensions to just a scalar, but what does it actually mean?
Geometric Interpretation Per (surprise) 3blue1brown, we can see that the dot product represents the length of the projection of one vector onto the other, multiplied by the length of that second vector</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/stats/lin_alg/linear_transformations/</guid>
      <description>Rethinking One of the best, earliest insights that I got from watching 3blue1brown&amp;rsquo;s excellent videos on The Essence of Linear Algebra is how to conceptualize a linear transformation performed by a matrix, A.
For starters, he conceptualizes everything he talks about relative to the unit vectors i and j, which are vectors of magnitude 1 that point in the x and y directions, respectively.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/basis_unit_vectors.PNG&amp;#39;) Thus, for any matrix, A, that defines a linear transformation, we should make it a habit to immediately identify the columns of A as mappings for these unit vectors.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/stats/lin_alg/null_space_and_kernels/</guid>
      <description>Main Idea 3blue1brown discusses Null Spaces in the context of inverse matricies.
If you map from one space to another using a matrix A then you can undo that mapping using its inverse, A^-1. That is, of course, provided that the matrix is invertible. This means&amp;ndash; among a ton of other things via the Invertible Matrix Theorem&amp;ndash; that the mappings between the two spaces is one-to-one.
Under this condition, we have a matrix A with a non-zero determinant, whose only solution that lands on the point [0 0]^T is the original point (0, 0).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not wildly off base to remark that a dendrogram, the visual result of Hierarchical Clustering, looks sort of like a Decision Tree, but in reverse.
(Pulled from Google Images)
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/dendrogram.PNG&amp;#39;) But whereas the Decision Tree starts from all points collected together and making successive splits to separate the data, Hierarchical Clustering starts with all disjoint points and iteratively finds groupings of similar points.
Algorithm Actually performing Hierarchical Clustering all begins with some measure of &amp;ldquo;dissimilarity.</description>

      <description>The Big Idea The key notion of of this notebook is that we want to formulate some line/hyperplane that we can use to draw a line through our data, maximizing separation between two classes.
After we&amp;rsquo;ve done this, prediction is as simple as:
 Draw the hyperplane Look at your point If it&amp;rsquo;s above the hyperplane, predict class A, otherwise B  Like most concepts we got out of ISL, we&amp;rsquo;ll start with a simple, straight-forward case and introduce complexity/relax assumptions until we get to the fancy-pants out-of-the-box implementations you might find in your favorite Data Science library.</description>

      <description>The concept of Boosting a given model extends, intuitively, from two other Data Science concepts:
 Principal Component Analysis, which aims to find an axis that explains the most variation, re-orient your original data, then find a new axis that explains what the first couldnt, etc Bootstrapping, which involves maximizing the use of a dataset by repeated sampling with replacement and aggregating model generation  Essentially, want to make simple model that predicts on y.</description>

      <description>Overview In general, when we fit a Decision Tree, we run the risk of putting together a model with extremely-high variance&amp;ndash; the tree that winds up being fit is highly dependent on how we split our data into train/test.
The following sections present methods for overcoming this shortcoming by building many different Decision Trees and leveraging them together for prediction. As outlined in our discussion of Boostrapping, we can counter this variance by aggregating our relevant statistics many times.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll cover actually building the tree below. So skipping ahead, after we&amp;rsquo;ve constructed our tree we wind up with m neat rectangles in some many-dimensional space. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that when we&amp;rsquo;re done, every single data point&amp;ndash; trained or new&amp;ndash; maps directly onto one of these m rectangles.</description>

      <description>As mentioned in our notebook on Decision Trees we can apply hard stops such as max_depth, max_leaf_nodes, or min_samples_leaf to enforce hard-and-fast rules we employ when fitting our Decision Trees to prevent them from growing unruly and thus overfitting.
Alternatively, Chapter 8 of ISL proposes a process called Cost Complexity Pruning, which acts as a sort of countermeasure for paring down a large tree that was trained more-or-less unpenalized. The method employs a constant alpha that penalizes our cost function for each of our terminal nodes for a given tree, denoted as |T|.</description>

      <description>from IPython.display import Image General Form Chapter 7 of ISL describes increasing our model complexity beyond simple, linear regression. We can add some complexity to our fit if we design our fit scheme to consider polynomial fits or step functions.
Generically though, we can express our linear form as
$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 b_1(x_i) + \beta_2 b_2(x_i) + \beta_3 b_3(x_i) + &amp;hellip; + \beta_K b_K(x_i) + \epsilon_i$

      <description>As mentioned in our notebook on Principal Component Analysis, the chief goal of a dimension reduction technique is to express the observations of our p-dimensional dataset, X as a linear combination of m-dimensional vectors (m &amp;lt; p), Z, using a mapping optimized &amp;ldquo;to explain the most variation in our data.&amp;rdquo;
But whereas PCA is an unsupervised method that involves figuring out how to explain variation in X, the Partial Least Squares method introduces a supervised alternative and considers our target, Y, in the dimension reduction.</description>

      <description>Motivation The majority of the time, our standard &amp;ldquo;build a model&amp;rdquo; workflow involves splitting a dataset up into train, test, and validation sets. However, this is all predicated on having enough data to split and derive meaningful inference.
In the event that we have a smaller dataset, we might employ the bootstrap method of oversampling from our population, with replacement, many times. Done enough times, we arrive at

      <description>Odds The probabilty of an event occuring is a simple ratio of &amp;ldquo;instances where it happens&amp;rdquo; divided by &amp;ldquo;all possibilities&amp;rdquo;, or
$\frac{ObservedTrue}{AllObservations}$
For example, rolling a 1 on a 6-sided die is
$\frac{1}{6} = .166667$
By contrast, the odds of an event is a flat look at &amp;ldquo;instances that it happens&amp;rdquo; against &amp;ldquo;instances that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen&amp;rdquo;. In our dice example, we&amp;rsquo;d simply have

      <description>More than Outliers The Stats 101 approach to data inspection is to take a look at your variables via some box-and-whisker plot, finding your outliers by examining whether they fall in or out of 1.5 times your IQR. Like so
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;./images/box_whisker.jpg&amp;#39;) This would alert us to points we&amp;rsquo;d consider dropping if our results look funny, but how do we describe the impact of these points on our models?</description>

      <description>Overview Short and sweet, a QQ plot is used to check the normality of a given data distribution.
Their construction is pretty straight-forward. Essentially you:
(Borrowing visuals from StatQuest):
 Sort your data and label each point as its own quantile (10th, 42nd, 99th, etc). Normalized data is your cleanest way to go here.  from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;../images/qq_data.PNG&amp;#39;)  Then, using the quantiles from step (1), fire up your vanilla N ~ (0, 1) distribution, and sample the same quantiles from it  Image(&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>Goal One of the key assumptions of any linear model is homoscedasticity, which&amp;ndash; apart from being a $2 word that I need to spellcheck every time&amp;ndash; means that the variance of your error terms stays generally-consistent across all fitted values.
Thus, it becomes essential to collect your error residuals and examine them against your predicted values. And if you&amp;rsquo;re being really diligent, your independent X variables, as well.
Visually, this basically means that we want to see the former, not the latter, of the two pictures below.</description>

      <description>Overview The F-Statistic of a Linear Regression seeks to answer &amp;ldquo;Does the introduction of these variables give us greater information gain when trying to explain variation in our target?&amp;rdquo;
I like the way that Ben Lambert explains and will paraphrase.
First you make two models&amp;ndash; a restricted model that&amp;rsquo;s just the intercept and an unrestricted model that includes new x_i values
$R: y = \alpha $
$U: y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$</description>

from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/r2_points.PNG&amp;#39;) We&amp;rsquo;d say that the Total Sum of Squares represents the combined amount of variation in Y across all points. In this case, we measure and sum the distance of each point (maroon) from the average Y value (red).
We square each value when we sum so values above and below the average height don&amp;rsquo;t cancel out.</description>

      <description>Cracking open the intermediate layers of a Convolutional Neural Network can be incredibly instructive and help reinforce your intuition for the types of features learned within a &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; algorithm. However, from an image classification standpoint, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to overstate just how effective seeing a simple heatmap of &amp;ldquo;decision attribution&amp;rdquo; can be for debugging and understanding the behavior of your model as a whole.
In this notebook, we&amp;rsquo;ll give a quick overview of an approach that lets us achieve just that&amp;ndash; adapted from Chapter 5 of Chollet&amp;rsquo;s excellent Deep Learning book.</description>

      <description>Occasionally, you might find yourself toying with a keras application that&amp;rsquo;s sufficiently complicated to merit graduating from the vanilla, Sequential() API to doing things functionally. While the expressiveness that this allows is immediately desirable for the sake of creativity, keeping a mental model of the model flow in your head becomes increasingly tedious. More to the point, the neat, vertical printout of model.summary() will likely do an insufficient job at relating the branching architecture you&amp;rsquo;ve created.</description>

      <description>Quick Color Checks When I found myself doing analysis on color using numpy, I kept getting turned around and having trouble conceptualizing the color representation for the R, G, B values I was seeing.
PIL makes this really easy to do. All you have to do is call Image.new() and specify the color parameter accordingly.
from PIL import Image rect = Image.new(mode=&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;, size=(200, 200), color=(0, 74, 127)) rect Layering in More Colors If we wanted to look at more colors than one at a time, we could probably leverage some matplotlib &amp;ldquo;span&amp;rdquo; method, or use the built-in tools that PIL provides.</description>

      <description>Being able to plot/generate graph-based images (be it networkx, a keras model structure, or what have you) is a very handy utility to have. However, the backend needed to support simple calls to, say keras.utils.plot_model() is nontrivial&amp;ndash; at least on Windows.
Getting the Binary sorted out Basically, the Python libraries used to do this kind of operation are actually wrappers/interfaces around a popular Open Source tool called Graphviz, so merely pip installing your library of choice only gets at the wrapper, not the underlying codebase that&amp;rsquo;ll do the heavy lifting.</description>

      <description>from IPython.display import Image Overview GANs have been in the Machine Learning spotlight since the seminal paper by Ian Goodfellow et al in 2014.
The general idea is that you&amp;rsquo;ve got a bunch of data that you want to learn &amp;ldquo;the essence of,&amp;rdquo; and you make yourself two networks:
 A Generator, G, that learns the underlying data generation distribution of our sample data (e.g. how you might express every R, G, B value in terms of some probability distribution), then uses random noise to generate new data A Discriminator, D, that learns to tell the difference between real data and data that the Generator passed  Then training just becomes:</description>

Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll comment on the things that stand out as non-obvious and important section by section
Building the Generator  Everything starts off by defining the generator_input relative to some latent_dim&amp;ndash; the dimension of our latent space that we&amp;rsquo;re going to use to generate noise.</description>

Maximum Likelihood Estimators are used to approximate probability distributions, given some data.
Though we don&amp;rsquo;t have every single data point that could possibly fall within a distribution, we can arrive at a decent guess for the parameters that define a distribution the data we do have.</description>

      <description>Motivation Image data&amp;ndash; particularly labeled image data&amp;ndash; is tough to come by. All told, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got 1000 images split, say, 500/250/250 and naively dump it into a model, you&amp;rsquo;re on a fast track to overfitting. A CV application that correctly spots a particular cat on the left side of an image should have no problem finding it on the right side if the image were flipped, yeah?
Data Augmentation, such as flipping, rotation, shearing, and zooming allows us to introduce noise and variability to our images, thus generating &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; training data.</description>

      <description>The keras API provides an excellent wrapper around various Deep Learning libraries, allowing both ease of use/uniform code while still plugging into expressive backends.
Generally speaking, keras allows two interfaces to the underlying libraries it abstracts:
 Sequential, object-oriented Functional, as the name implies  To explain the difference, we&amp;rsquo;ll make the same Network in both fashions. This will consist of:
 Creating the structure:  Dense, 32-node layer, that takes input shape 784 Another 2 Dense 32 layers A final Dense 10 layer with a softmax() activation function  Compiling the model with the categorical_crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer Printing a summary of our model  Sequential API from keras import layers from keras import models Using TensorFlow backend.</description>

      <description>Overview Principal Component Analysis is a technique used to extract one or more dimensions that capture as much of the variation of data as possible.
Intuition Following along with this YouTube video, say we have some data points that look like the following.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/pca_yt_1.png&amp;#39;) Most of the variation can be explained, not by x or y alone, but a combination of the two.
Image(&amp;#39;images/pca_yt_2.png&amp;#39;) Indeed, if you rotate the image relative to this axis, the data looks much more organized, with the most variance explained by our &amp;ldquo;new x axis&amp;rdquo;, and the second-most variance explained by our &amp;ldquo;new y axis.</description>

      <description>Simpson&amp;rsquo;s Paradox is an interesting statistical property that arises when you arrive at misleading conclusions due to overlooking confounding variables in your data.
Ultimately, the only way to overcome the paradox (should it even arise&amp;hellip;) is a thorough understanding of your data and that it represents.
Simple Overview This video was very helpful in helping me gain some intuition with simple examples.

      <description>As we mentioned in the Word2Vec notebook, training your Embedding Matrix involves setting up some fake task for a Neural Network to optimize over.
Stanford&amp;rsquo;s GloVe Embedding model is very similar to the Word2Vec implementation, but with one crucial difference:
GloVe places a higher importance on frequency of co-occurrence between two words.
Training Notes First, an enormous vocab_size x vocab_size matrix is constructed as a result of a pass through of your entire corpus to get all unique words.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/machine_learning/rnns/sentiment_analysis/</guid>
      <description>Given a Word Embedding that&amp;rsquo;s compatible with our corpus, could make a reasonably-accurate sentiment classifier by taking a naive average across all the encoding vectors in our sentence.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/sentiment_naive.png&amp;#39;) However, this approach falls short when you have an important context word that negates the rest of your sentence. For instance in the sentence
 Completely lacking in good taste, good service, and good ambiance
 The word &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; appears three times and likely out-weighs the negative word &amp;ldquo;lacking&amp;rdquo; enough that you might predict a &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; sentiment.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning applications ultimately boil down to a bunch of matrix multiplication plus some extra stuff. So seeing how it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to multiply strings by strings, it stands to reason that we want to represent our string data in some fashion.
Thankfully Word Embeddings do just this.
Overview Say we have a vocabulary, V, of 10,000 words that include
[a, aaron, ..., zulu, &amp;lt;UNK&amp;gt;]  (here, &amp;lt;UNK&amp;gt; is a stand-in for any words we might not have considered)</description>

      <description>One of the more popular characteristics of Word Embeddings is that it affords a way to look at the similarity between words.
Canonically, the GloVe embedding boasts the ability to serve up words in similar feature space and demonstrate that they have similar meaning.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/glove_nearest.PNG&amp;#39;) The above merely considers the straight-line distance between two points, but cosine similarity has been a shown to be a more effective similarity measure when working with text data.</description>

      <description>As mentioned in the Word Embeddings notebook, there are many ways to train a Neural Network to produce a Word Embedding matrix for a given vocabulary.
One of the more popular implementations of this is TensorFlow&amp;rsquo;s Word2Vec. This notebook should provide a high-level intuition of this training approach.
Fake Task The key takeaway for understanding how we fit an embedding layer is that we set our data up to solve an arbitrary problem when iterating over a corpus of text.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/machine_learning/rnns/gru/</guid>
      <description>The problem with regular Recurrent Neural Networks is that, due to the vanishing gradient problem, they struggle to remember specific information over a period of time. For instance the following sentences
The cat ate ... and was full The cats ate ... and were full  might be completely identical, save for the plurality of the subject, and by extension the tense of &amp;ldquo;was&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;were&amp;rdquo;
Memory Cells Gated Recurrent Units have this concept of a memory cell, c that learns and carries information from once layer to the next.</description>

Key Differences Andrew Ng diagrams this whole process nicely with the following.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/lstm_ng.PNG&amp;#39;) Couple things to point out here
Two Tracks Recall that in the GRU architecture, the output was the memory cell&amp;ndash; or rather, c==a
Here, however, there&amp;rsquo;s both an explicit memory cell that spans the top of each cell as well as an activation value that gets passed along the bottoms.</description>

      <description>Recurrent Neural Networks are designed to learn information from sequential data.
We start with datasets of x time steps in a row, for example:
 x words in a sentence x sequential stock ticks x days of weather in a row  Thus, we say that there are T_x elements in a given point of data.
In the most basic case, we have some handoff of information, a_i from layer i-1 to i.</description>

      <description>Overview One of the funner/more popular tricks you can employ using Deep Learning is the notion of style transfer between two images, like the canonical examples shown below.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/style_transfer.png&amp;#39;) To get started, you want to determine some cost function that takes into consideration both:
 Content: how similar the principal shapes are between the Content Image and the Generated Image (e.g. the bridge clock tower) Style: How much the Generated Image &amp;ldquo;looks/feels&amp;rdquo; like the Style Image  (more on these below)</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t yet understand how this works in practice, but wanted to get some thoughts down about the theory of how this all works.
Overview So for a given image, our model&amp;rsquo;s prediction will have the following scheme:
 Generate a box around an object, defined by  bx, by: coordinates of the center of the box bw, bh: width and height of the boxes  Note: these values are scaled as percentages between (0, 0) and (1, 1), as we assume unit length of the image  from IPython.</description>

      <description>As we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed in other notebooks, a key reason that we employ convolution to our image networks is to adjust the complexity of our model.
When we apply N convolutional filters to a given layer, the following layer has final dimension equal to N&amp;ndash; one for each channel.
1x1 Convolution Because convolution gets applied across all channels, a 1x1 convolution is less about capturing features in a given area of any channel, but instead translating information into other, easier-to-compute dimensions.</description>

      <description>Transfer learning is the act of using a pre-trained network as a way to give you a huge head start on training a neural network for whatever your current application is. There are a number of canonical networks floating around, all trained on significantly-better hardware than you or I readliy have on hand, furthermore, because so many of the earlier layers are so abstract, they&amp;rsquo;re often useful for whatever purpose you&amp;rsquo;re designing with, out of the box.</description>

      <description>Motivation Consider a very deep image-classification neural network like the one below
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/very_deep_network.png&amp;#39;) A typical shortcoming of this sort of architecture is overfitting of the data.
This is a result of information gain from back-propagation not making it all the way back to our earlier layers in the network (due to the vanishing gradient problem). After a certain point, the earlier layers stop changing much at all, and the later layers over-adjust to the data it&amp;rsquo;s trained on.</description>

      <description>One of the more popular Convolutional Network architectures is called VGG-16, named such because it was created by the Visual Geometry Group and contains 16 hidden layers (more on this below).
Essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s architecture can be described as:
 Multiple convolutional layers A max pooling layer Rinse, repeat for awhile A couple Fully Connected Layers SoftMax for multiclass predection  And that&amp;rsquo;s it. The key advantage of VGG is its simplicty.</description>

      <description>Confidence Interval vs Level If you&amp;rsquo;ve got a bunch of data and you&amp;rsquo;re trying to approximate the average value, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to bake in some wiggle room for your prediction.
Assuming that you&amp;rsquo;ve already cleared our usual sampling conditions, we want essentially want to come up with an expression of
$ourEstimate \pm marginOfError$
How we calculate this &amp;ldquo;marginOfError&amp;rdquo; depends on whether we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a sample mean or proportion (more below), but is basically the product of two parts:</description>

      <description>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got a few notebooks outlining the intuition and mechanics of Convolution with image-based Neural Nets, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how we go about structuring our model.
Example Architecture Andrew Ng maps out a potential architecture approach for modeling an MNist classifier.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/conv_mnist.png&amp;#39;) Few things to note here:
 Because there aren&amp;rsquo;t any learned parameters in our Pooling layers, we consider them &amp;ldquo;in the same layer as the adjacent Convolution step&amp;rdquo; The hyperparameters numFilters, filterShape, filterStride were all arbitrarily chosen and can be modified/explored from layer to layer to try and increase performance We do two layers of Convolution/pooling and then start using the same dense, robust layers as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen with our usual Networks.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/machine_learning/computer_vision/conv_hyperparams/</guid>
      <description>Motivation Our initial convolution intuition was built on the notion of a filter that scanned over an image extracting relevant features and reducing dimensionality into the next layers.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/conv_sliding.png&amp;#39;) However, applying similar filters in subsequent layers would create a telescoping effect where basically hack-and-slash away at the dimension of our data until there&amp;rsquo;s nothing left in the final layers.
Thankfully, there are hyperparameters we can employ to correct for this.</description>

      <guid>https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/machine_learning/computer_vision/conv_intuition/</guid>
      <description>What Is It? Convolution is a technique that is largely used in Image data as a method of abstracting simple features such as edges or color scale. It is an elegant technique, used in earlier layers of deep image networks to dramatically reduce computation and extract component features used in assembling more complicated features for later layers in the network.
Furthermore, in addition to learning the simple-feature characteristics on your data, the convolutional filter also *implicitly encodes the location* as well.</description>

      <description>Pooling is a technique used to efficiently reduce dimensionality, and therefore complexity and computation.
It involves sectioning off your original image and applying some reductive function to the values in those cells. Just like convolution, we can set filter size and stride hyperparameters to adjust the output size.
Example: Applying np.max() to the values
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/pooling.png&amp;#39;) Max Pooling is the preferred method over any other calculation (e.</description>

      <description>The following is an abbreviated look at Chapter 3 of Learning TensorFlow.
Workflow Working in TensorFlow boils down to two simple steps
 Construct your execution graph Run it in a session  Say you wanted to use TensorFlow to implement the following.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/graph.png&amp;#39;) Construct your execution graph Arriving at our final value of 5 requires a few intermediate values along the way. We could express this in pure python with the following:</description>

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression model = LogisticRegression() model.fit(X, y) true_probs = model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1] preds = (true_probs &amp;gt; .5).astype(int) The model will yield some distribution of predictions on the confusion matrix.</description>

      <description>Recall the effect of normalization on the cost function back when we considered Logistic Regression.
By recasting our data in terms of a fixed mean and standard deviation, it made our hypothetical cost function follow a rounder, evener distribution, thereby making our Gradient Descent approach much easier.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/normalization.png&amp;#39;) Batch Normalization essentially does the same thing, but for hidden layers of a Neural Network.

      <description>Note, these notes were taken in the context of Week 3 of Improving Deep Neural Networks
When your prediction task extends beyond a binary classification, you want to rely less on the sigmoid function and logistic regression. While you might see some success doing it anyways, and then doing some numpy.max() dancing over your results, a much cleaner approach is to use the SoftMax function.
The Math Essentially, softmax takes an arbitrary results vector, Z, and instead of applying our typical sigmoid function to it, instead does the following:</description>

      <description>Grid search isn&amp;rsquo;t always our best approach for figuring out our best hyperparameters.
In the example of Deep Learning and Adam Optimization, there are several different hyperparameters to consider. Some, like the alpha constant, need tuning. On the other hand, constants like epsilon are basically taken as granted and don&amp;rsquo;t affect the model.
from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/feature_grid.PNG&amp;#39;) By grid searching over any feature space that includes epsilon, we&amp;rsquo;re putting five times the computation on our system for less-than-negligible performance gain.</description>

      <description>Because of the way that we vectorize our implementations of forward and back propagation, the calculations on each step are done in a single matrix multiplication operation. This is great for performance&amp;rsquo;s sake, but at scale, it represents an issue. Because most deep-learning applications tend to amass huge datasets to get piped into them, it becomes increasingly difficult to perform all of these in-memory computations when you can&amp;rsquo;t, well, hold everything in memory.</description>

from IPython.display import Image Image(&amp;#39;images/momentum_1.png&amp;#39;) Traditionally, we know that there&amp;rsquo;s a large emphasis on the learning rate, alpha, that dictates the step size of our gradient descent.
Too large, and we wind up over-shooting paths that would allow us to converge sooner (purple). Too small, and it takes forever to run (blue).
Image(&amp;#39;images/momentum_2.png&amp;#39;) However, you look at these lines, they learn at a reasonable pace in the X plane, while oscillating back and forth in the Y.</description>

However, the following heuristics may prove useful:
 The weights matrix, WN and its partial dWN must have the same dimensions Same goes for the activation layers, A, and intermediate linear combinations, Z Working out the dimensions in advance gives you a good sanity check before you find yourself wrist-deep in numpy, trying to debug with obj.</description>

Then we calculate our error by taking a simple (actual - expected) and marching backwards through the Net using some small learning rate, and adjustments to each of the matricies.</description>

from IPython.display import ImageImage(&amp;#39;images/logit.PNG&amp;#39;) Our equation before,
$\hat{y} = w^{T} X + b$
was much simpler in the sense that:
 X was an n x m vector (n features, m training examples) This was matrix-multiplied by w an n x 1 vector of weights (n because we want a weight per feature) Then we broadcast-added b Until we wound up with an m x 1 vector of predictions  A Different Curse of Dimensionality Now when we get into Neural Networks, with multiple-dimension matrix-multiplication to go from layer to layer, things can get pretty hairy.</description>

And our bias unit

      <description>As described in the sampling distributions notebook, the larger your sample size, the less variability in your sampling distribution.
Thus, in order to make statistically-sound assertions, we have to collect a sufficient amount of data to be able to generalize results from our sample to our population.
Thankfully, there are some easy heuristics we can follow to ensure we&amp;rsquo;ve gathered enough data, and correctly.

      <description>Terminology Samples come from populations, and represent a smaller subset of all possible values.
 e.g. If you email 100 clients at random from a list of 10,000 clients.  Statistics describe samples whereas parameters describe populations (alliteration, FTW)
 e.g. The &amp;ldquo;average age of all clients&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;average age of the 100 clients we selected&amp;rdquo;  Symbols Generaly, Greek tends to mean population, whereas things with hats tend to mean sample.</description>

      <description>Populations follow distributions, which are likelihoods of values we expect to see. Not to be confused with an individual sample, a sampling distribution is the distribution of a particular statistic (mean, median, etc) across multiple repeated samples of the same size from the same population.
But what effect does sampling have on what you can infer that from your population?
Does the ratio of &amp;ldquo;4 out of 5 dentists&amp;rdquo; that recommend something extrapolate to all dentists or would it be more accurate to say &amp;ldquo;4 out of the 5 dentists that we asked&amp;rdquo;?</description>

For example
def dummy_fn(): name = input() return(&amp;#39;Hello, &amp;#39;, name)dummy_fn() Nick (&#39;Hello, &#39;, &#39;Nick&#39;)  Simulating a user input wound up being a non-trivial thing to figure out, so I figured it beared writing a note involving:

      <description>In addition to the ability to write, transform, and aggregate our data all over the place, manually, Spark also has a useful SQL-like API that we can leverage to interface with our data.
Not only does this provide a familiar logical-clarity to those with SQL, but like the language it&amp;rsquo;s based on, we get a lot of bang for our buck by describing what we want our final dataset to look like and let the optimizer figure out the rest.</description>

      <description>Missing data is a routine part of any Data Scientist&amp;rsquo;s day-to-day. It&amp;rsquo;s so fundamental, in fact, that moving over to PySpark can feel a bit jarring because it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as immediately intuitive as other tools.
However, if you can keep in mind that because of the way everything&amp;rsquo;s stored/partitioned, PySpark only handles NULL values at the Row-level, things click a bit easier.

      <description>I wanted to train some sort of sequence model on some mental health data I&amp;rsquo;d been capturing.
The data was stored as a flat .csv with a bunch of columns (omitted) representing various things I track per-entry, a couple columns (date, timestamp_id) to determine when the entry was, and finally, the mood_id, my target variable.
However, going from that table to something ingestible by a model took some creativity.</description>

      <description>Awhile back, I found myself wanting to do some preprocessing for a sequence model using pandas. I was pretty pleased with the solution that I came up with. However, when I took the plunge and started tooling up in PySpark, it quickly occurred to me that my neat, pandas.DataFrame.iloc solution wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be making the transition with me.
Unless of course, I was eager to toPandas() the whole thing right out of the gate, but that defeats the purpose of PySpark.</description>

      <description>Occasionally, our measures for model accuracy can be misleading. This typically occurs when our model fitting overly-generalizes to whatever data it was trained on, and the way we split out train/test sets don&amp;rsquo;t do a very good job of exposing the oversight.
To this end, we employ Validation Sets&amp;ndash; data held out of our Training Sets&amp;ndash; to approximate our Test Error.

      <description>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got the modeling basics down, you should have a reasonable grasp on what tool to use in what instance.
But after that step, the difference between a good model and a great model lies in the way you implement that solution. How many splits can your Decision Tree do? How do we normalize our Linear Regression (if at all!)?
To answer these types of questions, we might turn to the GridSearchCV object in sklearn.</description>

      <description>As we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in other notebooks, we can use built-in Imputer, StandardScaler, LabelEncoder, and LabelBinarizer classes in sklearn to do a good deal of the data-preprocessing heavy lifting.
However, under the hood, these all fit the same form:
Each class has inherits from the BastEstimator object and has a
 fit() method to fit the data transform() method that transforms the data fit_transform() that does the last two steps in sequence  Additionally, by inheriting from the TransformerMixin object, we get the fit_transform() method for free.</description>

Basically, for every predicted value, you:
 Find the difference between your prediction and the actual result Square each value Add each value together Take the square root of that Divide by the number of observations  This allows us to get an absolute-value measure of how far off from correct each prediction was, over or under.</description>

We can chain together successive preprocessing steps into one cohesive object. But doing so requires a bit of planning.

Thus, we have to transform our categorical data into a numerical representation.

      <description>You always need to keep track of where you&amp;rsquo;ve got missing data and what to do about it.
Not only is it the right thing to do from a &amp;ldquo;build a scalable model&amp;rdquo; approach, but sklearn will often throw its hands up in frustration if you don&amp;rsquo;t tell it what to do when it encounters the dreaded np.nan value.
The Data Let&amp;rsquo;s load the iris dataset
import numpy as np from sklearn.</description>

      <description>Standardizing your data before starting in on machine learning routines is paramount. Not only does it allow your algorithms to converge faster (by delta&amp;rsquo;ing over a much narrower scope of data), but it also prevents any features scaled arbitrarily larger from having an inflated weight on whatever your model winds up learning.
E.g. a &amp;ldquo;0, 1, 2 car garage&amp;rdquo; probably has more predictive power on a home value than &amp;ldquo;0-10,000&amp;rdquo; jelly beans could fit in the master bathtub.</description>

      <description>A good dataset to practice Regression techniques, we can load the Boston Housing Dataset saved directly to Scikitlearn using the dataset submodule.
Loading the Data from sklearn.datasets import load_boston data = load_boston() Doing so gives us a Bunch object
type(data) sklearn.utils.Bunch  Which is basically a dictionary, but with some other stuff
data.__class__.__bases__ (dict,)  Inspecting the Data Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the keys
data.keys() dict_keys([&#39;data&#39;, &#39;target&#39;, &#39;feature_names&#39;, &#39;DESCR&#39;])  The data and target keys are just numpy arrays</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s some Data Science 101 stuff to split your data out in order to validate the performance of your model. Thankfully, sklearn comes with some pretty robust batteries-included approaches do doing that.
Load a Dataset Here we&amp;rsquo;ll use the Iris Dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris data = load_iris() data.keys() dict_keys([&#39;data&#39;, &#39;target&#39;, &#39;frame&#39;, &#39;target_names&#39;, &#39;DESCR&#39;, &#39;feature_names&#39;, &#39;filename&#39;])  X = data[&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;] y = data[&amp;#39;target&amp;#39;]X.shape, y.shape ((150, 4), (150,))  Vanilla Split from sklearn.</description>

      <description>Namespaces in Classes In much the same way that modules and packages create namespaces and hold objects inside for use in scripts, classes hold attributes within each class definition for use in instances.
Motivation By using the the &amp;lsquo;__dict__&amp;rsquo; hidden method, we can interrogate the attributes of a class.
Vanilla case class Klass(object): def __init__(self): self.a = 1 ex = Klass()ex.__dict__ {&#39;a&#39;: 1}  Nested class Now if we make a class that inherits from our last class.</description>

However, as discussed in Transformations and Actions, nothing gets evaluated, merely strung together into RDDs. Only when we call some sort of Action do we get any actual computation.
Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a simple dataset

      <description>Caching Imports Whenever Python encounters an import or &amp;quot;from _ import _&amp;quot; statement, it:
1) Looks for that module in the Module Import Path
2) Compiles the file into byte code (maybe)
3) Runs the compiled byte code
Steps 1 and 2 can be pretty taxing, so to ease on computation it will
 Leave behind a __pycache__ file to skip out on step 2
 Make it easier to look up the module file next time</description>

      <description>There are various decorators that are useful when working with OOP. The three I want to highlight are
 @property @classmethod @staticmethod  @property While many other languages have getter and setter methods, Python does away with this by adopting a &amp;ldquo;responsibility lies with the user&amp;rdquo; approach and has all of its class/object nuts and bolts more or less accessible.
This provides a tough challenge when designing the class attributes, especially when you have multiple data fields that depend on a single object.</description>

      <description>Modules modules are .py files that contain variables and functions for use in other files.
Consider a simple file that lives in this directory.
!type localscript.py def test_fn(): print(&amp;quot;Sup&amp;quot;)  Importing it gives you access to the underlying functions using the &#39;.&#39; operator
import localscript localscript.test_fn() Sup  You can see what&amp;rsquo;s available to you by using the dir command
dir(localscript) [&#39;__builtins__&#39;, &#39;__cached__&#39;, &#39;__doc__&#39;, &#39;__file__&#39;, &#39;__loader__&#39;, &#39;__name__&#39;, &#39;__package__&#39;, &#39;__spec__&#39;, &#39;test_fn&#39;]  module object The import statement is actually a Python expression.</description>

      <description>Packages When regular ol&amp;rsquo; modules aren&amp;rsquo;t cutting it, you want to turn to packages. They allow you to, among other things:
 Better organize your code with explicit names  e.g. from email.message import Message  Only import what you need  __init__ files These files, tucked into subdirectories, establish a subdirectory as a namespace under the umbrella that is the package.

1) The home directory of the program
2) PYTHONPATH directories
3) Standard library directories

      <description>Overview The csv standard library is used for interfacting with&amp;ndash; strangely enough&amp;ndash; csv files.
Mechanically, working with csv files involves breaking up by lines, then by delimiter, and using the values.
However, these files aren&amp;rsquo;t beholden to a consistent format. Different rules regarding quotes, delimiters, and line separation can arise, kneecapping your ability to generalize how to work with the files.
The csv standard library can be handily leveraged as a translation layer in your data pipeline to resolve inconsistencies between these formats.</description>

Because Spark is more often than not used in the context of huge amounts of data, it only does expensive computation when absolutely needed. Before we get into the specifics, let&amp;rsquo;s review the notion of Lazy Evaluation
Lazy Evaluation Recall in vanilla Python (post 3.X) that the map function returns a cryptic map-object when thrown up against some data.</description>

However, writing generator functions can get messy beyond yielding one sequence.
Consider this function:
def range_then_exp(N): for i in range(N): yield i for i in (x**2 for x in range(N)): yield i For a given N, this yields the numbers 0 to N, then their squares.

      <description>Intro All of the pandas csv and text file parsing are done through the read_csv() and read_table() functions. These, in turn, inherit most of their behavior from the csv module in the Python standard library.
Because the end result of &amp;ldquo;parse data to get to a Dataframe&amp;rdquo; looks so tabular, it&amp;rsquo;s worth having a good understanding of how these two function calls work, even in higher-order data, as those methods will leverage these on the backend.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s our simple csv.
import pandas as pd csvPath = &amp;#39;data/ex1.csv&amp;#39; open(csvPath, &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;).read() &#39;a,b,c,d,message\n1,2,3,4,hello\n5,6,7,8,world\n9,10,11,12,foo&#39;  Dialect This should be immediately familar to anyone comfortable working in the csv standard library.

pd.read_csv(dateCsvPath).dtypes 2000-01-01 object 0 int64 dtype: object  However, you can tell the parser to use the parse engine in dateutil.</description>

      <description>Iterating After you&amp;rsquo;ve handled all of the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; to parse a csv, you can also specify &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; you get.

There are also a number of arguments that instruct how to handle/iterate through very large files.
